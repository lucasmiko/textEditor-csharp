# Text Editor Console Application

This repository contains a small project developed during a fundamentals course on C#. The project is a text editor that operates via the console.

## Course Overview

The Fundamentals of C# course provided a foundational understanding of the C# programming language. As part of the course, a text editor project was developed to showcase basic programming concepts and techniques using C#. The text editor operates within a console environment.

## Features
